# Application-for-simulation-of-motion-and-impact-of-spheres
In this application we will create a program with C++ which will simulate the motion and impact of spheres of the same mass moving on the same line segment of legth of 60. The diameter of every sphere is 1 distance unit. The point 0 lies at the left side of the line segment. The velocity of the spheres is the same and equal to 1 distance unit/time unit. The direction of motion on the line segment can be to the left or to the right. The simulation starts at time t = 0. The initial placement of the spheres on the line segment is taking place on positions that have the same lenght as the diameter of every sphere (1 distance unit). The 1st position (with number 0) corresponds to the segment [0,1] and the last one (with number 59) corresponds to the segment [59,60]. In a position can be located only one sphere. Those initial positions are given in an array named *position* in increasing order starting from the sphere in the 1st position on the line segment from the left and ending with the sphere in the last postions on the line segment to the right. This ordering corresponds to the coding of the spheres starting from the sphere with number 0 and ending to the sphere with number n-1.
